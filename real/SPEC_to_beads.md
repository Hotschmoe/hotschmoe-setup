If you were to break this project down into beads, how would you do it (timeline info does not need included and doesn't matter):

- Every **bead** should be an atomic, commitable piece of work with tests (and if tests don't make sense, another form of validation that it was completed successfully)

Be exhaustive, be clear, be technical, always focus on small atomic beads that compose up into a clear goal for the project ethos.

create your beads using `br` (beads_rust) - one bead per atomic task

Once you're done, provide this prompt to a subagent to review your work and suggest improvements. When you're done reviewing the suggested improvements update any beads as needed.
